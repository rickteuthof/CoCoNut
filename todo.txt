- Add options to disallowed subset of children in lifetimes. 
- Add pass checks. 
- Fix TODO's in code. 
- Make sure the coconut py works perfect. 
- Fix include paths for user, they are terrible. 
- Fix memory tracking.
- Move internal allocs to a different function, so they are not tracked.
- Make a max-heap for tracking of time and memory. 
- Move internal functions to different file based on type and flags.
- Rewrite the smap implementation or use stb?
- Make sure that the total number of types stays below a 16 bit number? 16 should be enough, gives around 60000 types.
